# Yelp-Star-rating-classifier
This is a very basic model to understand NLP in action. We take in text data, and labels named stars, and apply ML model post NLP application to the data, and predict the label for the yelp text message.
I have used BOW model and as well as simple TF-IDF transformer, and ran it through MultinomialNB model and the results are printed.
